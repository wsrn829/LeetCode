1. sort() and sorted() are both functions in Python used to sort elements, but they work differently.

sort(): 
- a method that belongs to the list class in Python. 
- sorts the list in-place and does not return a new list

sorted():
- a built-in function in Python. 
- returns a new list containing all items from the original list but in a sorted order (does not modify the original list).

2. only below methods are correct:

1) if key in dict: check if a key exists in a dictionary, O(1).
2) if key in dict.keys(): check if a key exists in a dictionary, O(n).
3) if value in dict.values(): check if a value exists in a dictionary
4) for key, value in dict.items(): Python for loop that iterates over the items (key-value pairs) in a dictionary.

3. The choice of -1 as the return value for indicating that the target is not found in the array is a convention that has been widely adopted in programming, especially in languages like C, C++, and Python, where array indices start from 0. 

4.  % : modulo operation, calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers.
   // : floor division, calculates the quotient of the division of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

5. Matrix is a special case of two two-dimensional arrays where each data element is of strictly the same size.
   So every matrix is also a two-dimensional array but not vice versa.
